  slug = short topic name, lowercase, hyphens (dashboard, social, sitemaps …)
  a    = plugin under test (left column)
  b    = competitor / comparison plugin (right column)

WHY: pairing by slug prevents the index-mismatch bug where RM-3 (Titles)
     gets shown next to NXT-3 (Social) just because they share index 3.

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>The dashboard is the first screen every user sees after installing the plugin, and right now it creates a deeply wrong first impression. The entire screen shows a heading "Site SEO Audit," a "Run Checks" button, and the message "No audit yet. Use Run Checks above." That is it. Nothing else until the user manually triggers a scan.</p>
<p>This is a critical activation problem. Activation is the moment a user first realizes value from your product. Plugin B passes this test immediately — open the dashboard and you see a grid of all active modules with on/off toggles. Users instantly understand what the plugin does, what is enabled, and what they might want to configure. Plugin A fails this test entirely because there is nothing to see.</p>
<p>The audit feature itself is a strong differentiator — automated site-wide SEO checks covering technical, on-page, WordPress settings, and integrations. But burying it as the only visible element on an empty dashboard makes it feel like a minimal product rather than a comprehensive SEO suite.</p>
<p><strong>What the dashboard should show:</strong> (1) An SEO health score — 0–100 from the last audit. (2) A module status row — icons showing Sitemap ✓, Schema ✓, Redirections ✓, LLMs.txt ✓/✗. (3) Quick stats — sitemap URL with copy button, active redirections count, last audit date. (4) A getting-started checklist for new installs with 5 steps: Connect to Google, Set up sitemap, Configure meta templates, Enable LLMs.txt, Run first audit.</p>
<p><strong>RICE impact:</strong> Dashboard redesign scores 12,000 RICE. A new user onboarding checklist alone scores 16,000 — the highest XS-effort item after the LLMs.txt fix. These two changes together would dramatically improve week-1 activation and reduce users who install and think "this plugin doesn't do much."</p>

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>Meta templates — patterns that define how titles and descriptions are generated for every page on your site — are the most frequently configured settings in any SEO plugin. Every site owner touches this. The question is whether Plugin A gives them enough control.</p>
<p>Plugin B's 14-tab Titles and Meta panel gives separate configuration for: Global Meta (fallback), Local SEO (name, address schema), Social Meta (Facebook, Twitter defaults), Homepage, Posts, Pages, and then a tab for every custom post type and taxonomy registered on the site. This granularity matters enormously. A WooCommerce store needs different patterns for products vs. category pages. A news site needs different patterns for Articles vs. Podcasts vs. Videos. Plugin A's single page cannot handle this level of control.</p>
<p>The Playwright test counted 0 inputs on the Meta Templates page — almost certainly a React rendering timing issue, not a missing UI. But even if all settings are present, the UX needs tabs or accordion structure clearly separating each content type. A user scrolling through a long flat page of settings for all post types gets lost quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The job to be done:</strong> "When I configure my site's SEO, I want to set the meta title and description pattern for each content type separately so that different pages get appropriate, specific patterns rather than one generic format." Plugin A partially addresses this but the execution needs significant UX improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Missing capabilities:</strong> No Global Meta fallback, no per-taxonomy meta control, no search results page meta, no 404 page meta, no pagination handling settings (?page=2), no date archive meta settings.</p>

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata directly controls how your content appears when shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, X, WhatsApp, and every other social platform. For most content businesses, the OG image is the single highest-impact visual impression their brand makes. Getting this right is critical and every SEO plugin puts it prominently.</p>
<p>Plugin B places social settings inside the same panel as meta templates — which is the right call. Users naturally think "how this page looks to the world" as a unified concept. Plugin A splits it: meta templates live under General > Meta Templates, social settings live under General > Social. This creates a split mental model and means users frequently configure one without knowing about the other.</p>
<p>The test showed 0 interactive elements on the Social page — this is almost certainly a React rendering issue, not a missing UI, because the build file confirms social meta code exists. But the zero count highlights a deeper problem: if automated tests can't find inputs, users on slower connections or older browsers may also have issues seeing the settings.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest missing element:</strong> A default OG image uploader with visual preview. This is RICE item #3 at 28,000 score with XS effort. When a post has no featured image, the OG image falls back to this default. It should be the hero element of the Social settings page — a large image upload zone with a preview of how it will look in a Facebook share.

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>Sitemaps are one of the most fundamental SEO features — a list of all your URLs submitted to Google so they know what exists on your site. Plugin A wins this comparison because sitemap.xml returns 200 and valid XML, while Plugin B's sitemap_index.xml returns 404 in the test environment. To be fair, the 404 is a test environment issue caused by WordPress rewrite rules not being flushed after plugin activation in Docker — this almost certainly works on a real WordPress install. But it affected UAT confidence.</p>
<p>Plugin A's Sitemaps page under Advanced > Sitemaps has the right controls in the right place. The issue is presentation. Users need the sitemap URL displayed prominently so they can copy it for Google Search Console submission. The URL should be at the top of the Sitemaps settings page in a text field with a one-click copy button — RICE item #5 at 13,000 score, XS effort.</p>
<p>Code analysis revealed that Plugin A supports video sitemap and news sitemap via rewrite rules. These are advanced features that need to be surfaced clearly in settings — not buried as checkboxes. Video sitemaps can significantly improve video content indexation. News sitemaps are required for Google News publisher status. Both deserve their own sub-sections with documentation links.</p>
<p><strong>Sitemap refresh strategy:</strong> Both plugins should auto-regenerate the sitemap when new content is published or deleted. If Plugin A is already doing this, show users a "Last regenerated: X minutes ago" timestamp. If it is not, it is a critical missing feature.</p>

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>Schema markup is structured data in JSON-LD format that helps Google and AI systems understand what your content is about. Both plugins output the same baseline schema on the homepage: Organization, Person, and WebSite types. This is the minimum required for a credible SEO plugin, and both pass this test.</p>
<p>However, schema is where SEO plugins differentiate significantly at the advanced level. Plugin B allows setting the schema type per post directly in the Gutenberg editor — you can mark a post as Article, Recipe, Product, HowTo, FAQ, Review, Event, LocalBusiness, or VideoObject. Each type generates the appropriate JSON-LD structure that Google uses to display rich results in search results. Rich results have measurably higher click-through rates.</p>
<p>Whether Plugin A has per-post schema selection in the Gutenberg sidebar is unknown from this test — the Playwright test only visited the admin Schema settings page, not the post editor. This is the most important follow-up test to run. If Plugin A has per-post schema selection and it is just not documented prominently, that is a marketing problem. If it does not exist, it is a critical product gap.</p>
<p><strong>Schema Validation:</strong> Neither plugin in this UAT showed a "validate before publish" feature. A user should be able to click "Test Schema" and see whether their JSON-LD will pass Google's rich results test — reducing the iteration cycle from "publish → wait 2 weeks" to an instant validation loop. This is a high-value differentiator for whichever plugin ships it first.</p>

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>Redirections are among the most frequently used SEO maintenance tools. Every time a URL changes — a post gets renamed, a category moves, a product page is deleted — you need a 301 redirect from the old URL to the new one. Without redirects, every old inbound link and Google-indexed URL becomes a 404 error, losing all the PageRank and traffic that URL had accumulated.</p>
<p>Plugin A has a Redirection Manager. The test confirmed it loads and has an Add button. This is genuinely good. The catastrophic problem is that nobody will ever find it. The path to reach it is: WordPress admin menu → Plugin → Content SEO → click into React SPA → click Advanced dropdown → click Redirection Manager. That is five interactions from the admin menu. Plugin B puts Redirections directly in the top-level admin submenu — one click from anywhere in the admin.</p>
<p>This is not a feature gap. It is a discoverability catastrophe. Users who need to add a redirect will search the WordPress admin for a "Redirections" link, find nothing, assume Plugin A doesn't have it, and install a separate plugin. They then have two plugins doing the same job. Some will eventually discover the built-in version, but many won't.</p>
<p><strong>The fix takes two hours:</strong> Add "Redirections" as a WordPress admin submenu item that links directly to the Redirection Manager hash URL inside the React SPA. RICE score is 30,000 — the second highest in the entire backlog with XS effort.</p>
<p><strong>Feature gaps once discovered:</strong> (1) Hit counter showing how many times each redirect has been triggered. (2) Import from CSV or .htaccess for sites migrating from another plugin. (3) 404-based suggestions — "these URLs are generating 404 errors, do you want to create redirects?" This last one is what makes Plugin B's redirections tool a closed-loop SEO workflow.</p>

    "pm_analysis": """
<p>IndexNow is a protocol supported by Microsoft Bing, Yandex, and others that allows websites to instantly notify search engines when content is published, updated, or deleted. The benefit is that new content gets indexed within hours instead of days or weeks. For news sites, content creators, and anyone who publishes frequently, this is a significant advantage.</p>
<p>Plugin A has an Instant Indexing settings page. The test detected 0 input fields — likely because the React component requires a prior action (generating an API key or connecting an account) before showing the key input field. This gated UX is friction. Plugin B shows the API key input field immediately on the module page, allowing instant configuration.</p>
<p><strong>The right UX flow for IndexNow:</strong> Step 1: Auto-generate an IndexNow API key (generate a random 32-character hex string — no user input needed). Step 2: Display the generated key with instructions. Step 3: Show a "Submit All URLs" button and a "Submission Log" of the last 50 URLs submitted with timestamps. Step 4: Toggle for "Auto-submit on publish/update." If Plugin A requires the user to do step 1 manually before anything appears, that explains the 0 inputs and represents a UX improvement opportunity.</p>

<p>LLMs.txt is an emerging standard for communicating with AI language models about your website. Just as robots.txt tells search engine crawlers what to index, LLMs.txt tells AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini what your site is about and how your content should be represented in AI responses. As AI-powered search grows to represent 15–30% of search traffic by 2027, having control over how your content appears in AI responses will be as important as traditional SEO.</p>
<p>Plugin A is the only plugin in this comparison with LLMs.txt support. This is a genuine competitive moat and could be Plugin A's primary marketing differentiator for 2026. The problem is that it does not work. The test navigated to /llms.txt and received a 404 error. This means the settings page exists and users can configure it, but when the file is served, WordPress returns 404.</p>
<p>The root cause is almost certainly missing rewrite rules. WordPress needs a rewrite rule added to serve requests to /llms.txt through the plugin's handler instead of returning 404. The fix is to add rewrite rules in the plugin's activation hook or whenever LLMs.txt settings are saved — identical to how sitemap rewrite rules work. This is XS effort.</p>
<p>The RICE score for this fix is 54,000 — the highest in the entire backlog. XS effort. Massive impact.

<p>A Status and Tools page is not glamorous. Users rarely open it. But when something goes wrong — and in WordPress, something always eventually goes wrong — the support team, the developer, and the site owner all need a place to quickly see the plugin's current state. Without a status page, every support ticket requires a back-and-forth about versions, settings, and configuration. With a status page, the user can copy and paste a system summary with one click.</p>
<p>Plugin B's Status and Tools page includes: System Status (WP version, PHP version, plugin version, active modules list), Database Tools (recalculate SEO scores, recount redirects, clear analytics data), Import/Export (backup and restore all settings), and Version Control (rollback to previous plugin versions). This is a comprehensive tools panel that serves multiple different jobs.</p>
<p>Plugin A has Import/Export as a tab in the main SPA. This covers one of four categories but is missing three of them. The System Status functionality is particularly important for support escalations. Without it, the support team has no efficient way to diagnose configuration issues remotely.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum viable Status page for Plugin A:</strong> WordPress version, PHP version, plugin version, active features list (sitemap ✓, schema ✓, LLMs.txt ✓/✗, redirections ✓), last audit date, sitemap URL and status, redirect count, and a "Copy for support" button that formats all of this into a clipboard-ready text block. This is a one-sprint feature that significantly improves the support experience for both users and the support team.</p>
